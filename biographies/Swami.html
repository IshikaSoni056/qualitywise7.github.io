                                          <strong>8. Non secular Quest:</strong> Narendranath's spiritual journey
                                          intensified as he
                                          grappled with the existential questions that haunted him. He became
                                          associated with the Brahmo Samaj, a outstanding socio-religious reform
                                          motion in India. however, it turned into his meeting with Ramakrishna
                                          Paramahamsa that proved to be a turning factor in his existence.
                                          Ramakrishna identified Narendranath's religious capacity and became his
                                          spiritual manual.

                                          <strong>9.Character: </strong> Swami Vivekananda, a prominent Hindu figure,
                                          represented Hinduism at the
                                          1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago. His universalistic speech, "Sisters
                                          and brothers of America," gained him popularity. He traveled and lectured
                                          extensively, promoting Hindu philosophy and tolerance. Despite his
                                          premature death in 1902, his teachings continue to inspire people globally.
                                          His Ramakrishna project continues to be a significant force in philanthropy
                                          and education.
